White people explaining Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr.’s activism to Black people is extremely condescending. It is important not to glamorize the 1960’s Civil Rights Movement, as many of the historical marches that have been circulating on social media often ended tragically. Protests were not peaceful for the protestors, even when they remained nonviolent. The police, KKK, and White Americans were extremely violent towards peaceful Black protesters and many Black people were injured or killed. Interestingly, while many protestors remained peaceful, some demonstrations during the Birmingham campaign were intended to provoke a hostile response from Whites. Violence is a headline grabber, and protesters intended to expose the brutalities of Jim Crow America to the broader population. Additionally, while MLK advocated for non-violence, other Civil Right leaders didn’t, like Malcolm X. But that’s a different topic."

At the end of the day, we don’t know what MLK Jr. would have wanted because he was killed like many other Civil Rights-era activists. What we do know, however, is that he said, “A riot is the language of the unheard. And what has America failed to hear?” Black Americans haven’t been heard for a really long time. They were criticized for peaceful protests, such as kneeling during the national anthem and wearing shirts that said “I can't breathe” during a basketball game. They’ve been peacefully marching and protesting against police brutality and systemic racism for decades, but nothing has changed.  Bernice King, MLK’s daughter, said that “many who quote him now and evoke him to deter justice today would likely hate, and may already hate, the authentic King.” Before he died, 63% of America viewed Dr. King unfavorably, but then the US glamorized him when he was killed. Those who bring up MLK are undermining the protests and riots occurring today, regardless of their intentions. As Martin Luther King Jr. said the  “certain conditions” which exist in society have to be “condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots."
